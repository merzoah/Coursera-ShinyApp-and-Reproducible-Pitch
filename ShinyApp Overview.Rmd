## Overview
The idea of this application is to let users be able to predict their vehicles' MPG by entering specs such as transmission type, weight, horse power, and number of cylinders.

## Dataset
For this application, we used the mtcars dataset from datasets library The summary of the dataset is below:

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Model
We used lm to fit a multivariable regression; mpg as outcome, am, cyl, hp, and wt as predictors. The coefficients is shown below:

```{r}
lm(mpg ~ am + cyl + hp + wt, data = mtcars)
```
